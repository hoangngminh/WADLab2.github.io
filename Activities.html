                        <h3>Football</h3>
                        <p>I have played football since primary school. Although I played normally, it has become a big passion for me after many years. After COVID-19, I stopped playing football. I also watch a lot of football matches, and Manchester City is the team I have loved since my early secondary school years.</p>

                        <h3>Badminton</h3>
                        <p>This is just a subject I take during physical education, but it still helps my health a lot because sometimes I will go to play with my friends.</p>

                        <p>This is one of the activities that I like the most. Since I went to university, I often go to Vung Tau or to the West by motorbike with my friends. Besides, during Tet and summer, I will go to Da Lat to relax because my friend has a villa up there.</p>

                        <h3>Billiards</h3>
                        <p>After Hanoi Open 2023 was held for the first time in Vietnam, the billiards movement in Vietnam is very popular, and I am no exception. Although I have been playing for 4 years, I do not try too hard in this sport but I am still quite serious when playing, I also have my own cue. I hope I will maintain playing for many years to come.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the professional billiard players in Vietnam.</p>
